Building a voting software involves several key functions to manage the various aspects of the voting process. Here are some functions you might consider implementing in Python:

1. **Voter Registration:**
   - `register_voter(name, voter_id, other_details)`: Registers a new voter with the system.

2. **Candidate Registration:**
   - `register_candidate(candidate_name, party_affiliation, other_details)`: Registers a candidate for an election.

3. **Election Setup:**
   - `setup_election(election_details)`: Sets up the parameters and details for an upcoming election.

4. **Voting:**
   - `cast_vote(voter_id, candidate_id)`: Allows a registered voter to cast a vote for a specific candidate.

5. **Vote Counting:**
   - `count_votes(election_id)`: Counts the votes for each candidate in a specific election.

6. **Results Reporting:**
   - `generate_results(election_id)`: Generates and displays the election results.

7. **Security Checks:**
   - `verify_voter(voter_id)`: Verifies the eligibility and authenticity of a voter before allowing them to cast a vote.

8. **Audit Trail:**
   - `log_activity(activity_details)`: Logs important activities, such as voter registration, candidate registration, and vote casting, for auditing purposes.

9. **User Authentication:**
   - `authenticate_user(username, password)`: Authenticates users, such as election administrators, before allowing access to sensitive functions.

10. **Data Persistence:**
    - Functions to store and retrieve data from a database or file system to maintain information about voters, candidates, elections, and votes.

11. **Error Handling:**
    - `handle_error(error_message)`: Handles errors gracefully, providing informative messages to users and logging details for debugging.

12. **User Interface:**
    - `display_menu()`: Displays a menu of options for users to interact with the voting software.

13. **Data Validation:**
    - `validate_data(data)`: Validates input data to ensure it meets the required format and constraints.

14. **Time Management:**
    - `check_voting_period()`: Ensures that voting occurs only during the designated time period.

15. **Communication:**
    - `send_notification(message, recipient)`: Sends notifications to relevant parties, such as voters or administrators.

Remember to implement appropriate security measures, such as encryption, to protect sensitive data, and ensure that your software complies with any relevant legal and ethical standards. Additionally, thorough testing is crucial to identify and address potential issues with the software.


Every spiritual transactions done on my behalf 
if there is no seed in the ground, havest should not be expected

how to nurture your seed to a point of harvest
Things that hinder seed  
Don't walk in unbelieve - Hebrews 4:2 - 
Mark 9:20
Cares of this world - Mark 4:14: Dont worry, dont be afraid... 
Whenever I come late, it is because, I am coming to show-off 

Sin - Rom 6:1
Grace can expire
We are careless of our live because we dont understand how valuable the price paid through the blood of Jesus.

there are no time you pray that your prayer is not processed in heaven --- 
Any demonic hand that will not allow miracle to stay - dry up now.

Every negative pronouncement, afflicting my life
Word is bigger than pronouncement 
Let the Word swallow every evil pronouncement.
Voice will not say dont labour, 
Let my bountiful harvest come hastily...
havest that will make cry, cry of joy....
Iyanu
